    <p data-view-type="course">Modern digital technology has made it possible to manipulate multi-dimensional signals. The goal of this manipulation can be divided into three categories:</p>
    <ul data-view-type="course">
      <li data-view-type="live">Image Processing image in -> image out</li>
      <li data-view-type="live">Image Analysis image in -> measurements out</li>
      <li data-view-type="live">Image Understanding image in -> high-level description out</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-view-type="course">We will first focus on some fundamental concepts of image processing. Then some introduction on image analysis will be given. Image understanding should be the aim of using different imaging techniques and requires a lot of expertise and experience. In this chapter we will restrict ourselves to two–dimensional (2D) image processing and 2D image analysis, although most of the concepts and techniques that are to be described can be extended easily to three dimensions (see Chapter on X-ray CT and OctopusAnalysis/Morpho+).</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">A first group of image processing operations are those procedures applied to correct some of the defects in acquired images that may be present due to imperfect detectors, limitations of the optics, inadequate or non-uniform illumination or an undesirable viewpoint. It is important to emphasize that these corrections are applied after the image has been digitized and stored and therefore are unable to deliver the highest quality result that can be achieved by optimizing or correcting the acquisition process in the first place. Of course, it is not always possible to obtain a perfect digital image in reality.</p>

    <ul data-view-type="live">
      <li data-view-type="live">digital images can be represented by: values from 0 (black) to 255 (white), producing one byte (8 bit) values, or for colour images one byte each for red, green, and blue.</li>

      <li data-view-type="live">No reason that the actual image data must cover the full range.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-view-type="course"><strong>Contrast expansion</strong></p>
    <p data-view-type="course">We have already seen that the typical digitization process for images produces values from 0 (black) to 255 (white), producing one byte (8 bit) values, or for colour images one byte each for red, green, and blue. If the camera and digitizer have more precision, the values may have 10, 12, or even more bits of precision and typically occupy two bytes each. But while this is the full dynamic range available to the output of the camera sensors, there is no reason that the actual image data must cover the full range.</p>

However, many of the gray values still show zero counts in the histogram, indicating that no pixels have those values. The reassignment of gray values has increased the visual contrast for the pixels present, but has not increased the ability to discriminate subtle variations in gray scale that are not recorded in the original image. It has also magnified the brightness differences associated with noise in the original image.</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">The top figure on this slide shows the same field of view acquired utilizing the entire range of the camera and digitizer. This may require adjusting the illumination, camera gain, or exposure time, etc., and may require trial and error in the settings, which are simplified if a live histogram can be shown. The mean brightness of various structures is similar to that shown in the previous slides. However, all of the 256 possible gray values are now present in the image, and small variations in sample density can now be distinguished</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">However, it is often not practical to adjust the illumination, camera gain, etc., to exactly fill the available pixel depth (the number of gray levels that can be digitized or stored). Furthermore, increasing the brightness range too much can cause pixel values at the dark and/or light ends of the range to exceed the digitization and storage capacity and to be clipped to the limiting values, which also causes loss of information. The figure on the bottom shows an example of  a night scene in which the brightness scale of the face of the building is good but bright lights are brighter than the white limit of the camera and consequently are clipped to the maximum value of 255, while the dark areas around the building are underexposed and clipped to zero (black), losing any detail that might have been present.</p>

    <ul data-view-type="live">
      <li data-view-type="live">counting statistics in the image detector due to a small number of incident particles (photons, electrons, etc.).</li>
      <li data-view-type="live">due to instability in the light source or detector during the time required to scan or digitize an image.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-view-type="course">However, one unavoidable source of noise is counting statistics in the image detector due to a small number of incident particles (photons, electrons, etc.). Noisy images may also occur due to instability in the light source or detector during the time required to scan or digitize an image. The pattern of this noise may be different from the essentially Gaussian noise due to counting statistics, but it still shows up as a variation in brightness in uniform regions of the scene.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">When the noise has a characteristic that is not random in time and does not exhibit “normal” statistical behaviour, it is more difficult to place meaningful numeric descriptors on the amount of noise. However, many of the same techniques can be used, usually with somewhat less efficacy, to reduce the noise.</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">Assuming that an image represents the best quality that can practically be obtained, we will focus on ways to suppress noise to improve the ability to visualize and demarcate for measurement the features which are present. The underlying assumptions in all of these methods are that the pixels in the image are much smaller than any of the important details, and that for most of the pixels present, their neighbours represent the same structure. Various averaging and comparison methods can be applied based on these assumptions.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">There are important differences between noise reduction by the use of frame averaging to combine many sequential readouts from a camera and the use of a camera that can integrate the charge internally before it is read out. The latter mode is employed in astronomy, fluorescence microscopy, and other applications with very faint images and is sometimes called “staring” mode since the camera is open to the incident light.</p>

    <p data-view-type="course">The figure shows a comparison of two SEM images taken at different scan rates. The fast scan image collects few electrons per pixel and so has a high random noise level that obscures details in the image. Slowing the scan rate down from 1 second to 20 seconds increases the amount of signal and reduces the noise. The histograms show that the variation of brightness within the uniform region is reduced (the peak is narrowed), which is why the visibility of detail is improved.</p>
    <p data-view-type="course">Many digital cameras allow setting an equivalent ASA rating, corresponding to film sensitivity. The higher the ASA rating the shorter the exposure and/or the smaller the aperture used to capture the image. This requires a higher gain in the amplification of the signal, producing a higher level of random noise. </p>
